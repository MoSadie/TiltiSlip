## 1.0.0

Initial public release. Should be stable enough for others to use.

Added features:
- Numpad keys to manually trigger actions for testing & demo usage. (for example so the streamer can know what each action does or show to viewers)
- Information popup when joining a ship, with the option to temporarily disable TiltiSlip for that ship.

## 0.1.0

Initial coding for stream.
