# TiltiSlip

Trigger in-game actions based on Tiltify donations. Chaos caused by charity, nothing more fun than that!

## Available Actions

The action is chosen based on the last number in the donation amount. (e.g. $5.23 triggers action 3)

You can use the number pad to manually trigger each action for testing/demonstration. (See [Testing TiltiSlip](https://mosadie.link/tswiki/Testing-TiltiSlip#testing-tiltislip-without-tiltify) for more details)
