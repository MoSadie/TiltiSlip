# TiltiSlip

Trigger in-game actions based on Tiltify donations.

For now: THIS WAS CODED QUICKLY FOR MY STREAM. This is not ready for a public ready-to-use release. You can absolutely try to set it up but no guarantees it will work. Mainly posting it now so inspiration can happen.

## Requirements

- [Slipstream: Rogue Space (on Steam)](https://playslipstream.com)
- One of the following:
    - [r2modman](https://thunderstore.io/c/slipstream-rogue-space/p/ebkr/r2modman/)
